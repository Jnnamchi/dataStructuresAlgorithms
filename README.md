# dataStructuresAlgorithms
A survey of fundamental algorithms and data structures for Javascript programming

This repository contains a survey of classic algorithms and data structures fundamental to every software engineer. The exercises reflect the most common questions asked in entry-level software engineering roles and have strong overlap with the famous book series "Cracking the coding interview"

The exercises and solutions (in alphabetical order) are as follows:

<li>Anagrams</li>
Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of eachother.
anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') --> True
anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') --> False
\n
<li>Binary Search Tree</li>
Implement the Node class to create a binary search tree. Implement the 'insert' method for the Node class to insert a new node into the tree. Implement the 'contains' method for the Node class which accepts a 'data' argument and returns the Node in the tree with the same value.
\n
<li>Capitalize</li>
The function should capitalize the first letter of each word in the string then return the capitalized string.

<li>Chunk</li>
Given an array and chunk size, divide the array into many subarrays where each subarray is of length size, for example:
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) --> [[ 1, 2], [3, 4]]
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) --> [[ 1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

<li>Circular</li>
Given a linked list, return true if the list is circular, false if not.

<li>Events</li>
Create an 'eventing' library out of the Events class and create methods 'on', 'trigger', and 'off'.
